[1:02:28 AM] Marshall @ RealEstate-VAs: 0.) Make sure all cookies & cache is clear in whichever browser you'll be using.

1.) Log on to VPN using IP address that is near to the posting location.

2.) Open a new "Private" / "Incognito" Browser window.

3.) Go to the Craigslist city you'll be posting.

4.) Login to the PVA (Phone Verified Account).

5.) Post the ad.

6.) Make sure it is live.

7.) Clear the Cookes / Cache (shouldn't be any if you are using Incognito... but still do it just in case).

8.) Sign out, repeat for additional posts.
[1:03:22 AM] Marshall @ RealEstate-VAs: For "1.) Log on to VPN using IP address..."

I think the best approach will be for someone to manually match up our available PVAs to specific VPN IP locations (eg: Cityname, State, Witopia VPN)
